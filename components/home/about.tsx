        Hello! I'm Md Foysal Ahmed, a passionate Full Stack Developer with expertise in building modern web applications using Next.js, React, Node.js, and more. I love creating efficient and scalable solutions that provide great user experiences.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-2'>
        With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies and improve my skills. When I'm not coding, I like to explore new tech trends, contribute to open-source projects, and connect with other developers in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just say hi!
