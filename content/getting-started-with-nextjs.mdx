Next.js 15 brings powerful new features that make building modern web applications easier than ever. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features:

- **React Server Components** - Write components that run on the server
- **Improved Performance** - Faster builds and better runtime performance
- **Enhanced Developer Experience** - Better error messages and debugging tools
- **Turbopack** - The new Rust-based bundler for lightning-fast development

## Getting Started

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## React Server Components

Server Components allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size sent to the client:

```tsx
// This is a Server Component by default
export default function Page() {
  const data = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const json = await data.json();

  return <div>{json.title}</div>;
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Performance** - Less JavaScript shipped to the client
2. **Improved SEO** - Server-rendered content is immediately available
3. **Enhanced Security** - Sensitive operations stay on the server
4. **Simplified Data Fetching** - No need for useEffect or state management

## Client Components

When you need interactivity, use the `"use client"` directive:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

## App Router

The new App Router is built on Server Components and supports:

- Layouts and nested routing
- Loading states
- Error boundaries
- Parallel routes
- Intercepting routes

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 represents a major leap forward in web development. By embracing Server Components and the new App Router, you can build faster, more efficient applications with less code.
