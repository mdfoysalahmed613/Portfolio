## Project Overview

**ChainStore** is a template marketplace where developers can purchase production-ready web templates using cryptocurrency. Built for the NEAR Protocol Hackathon, it integrates HOT Pay for seamless crypto payments on the NEAR blockchain.

The platform demonstrates how blockchain payments can power real digital commerce — with instant delivery, no middlemen, and cryptographic payment verification.

### Key Features

- **Crypto Payments** — Purchase templates with cryptocurrency via HOT Pay on NEAR
- **Instant Downloads** — Immediate access to template files after payment confirmation
- **Live Previews** — Preview templates before purchasing with demo links
- **User Dashboard** — View purchases, spending stats, and re-download templates
- **Tech Stack Badges** — See the technologies used in each template at a glance

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

| Technology          | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Next.js 16**      | App Router, React Server Components     |
| **React 19**        | Modern component-based UI               |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility-first responsive styling        |
| **shadcn/ui**       | Accessible, production-ready components |
| **Lucide React**    | Icon library                            |
| **TypeScript**      | End-to-end type safety                  |

### Backend & Blockchain

| Technology        | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Supabase**      | PostgreSQL database, Auth, Row-Level Security |
| **HOT Pay**       | Crypto payment processing on NEAR Protocol    |
| **NEAR Protocol** | Blockchain layer for trustless payments       |
| **Webhooks**      | Payment confirmation from HOT Pay             |

## How It Works

1. **Browse** — Explore the catalog of production-ready templates with previews
2. **Purchase** — Click "Buy with Crypto" and complete payment via HOT Pay
3. **Download** — Template files become instantly available in your dashboard

Each payment is recorded on the NEAR blockchain, providing full transparency and verifiability.

## Architecture Highlights

### Payment Flow

```
User clicks "Buy with Crypto"
  → POST /api/orders (creates pending purchase with unique memo UUID)
  → Redirect to HOT Pay payment page
  → User completes crypto payment on NEAR
  → HOT Pay webhook confirms transaction
  → Payment status page polls /api/orders/verify every 3 seconds
  → Purchase marked "completed", download unlocked
```

### Database Design

- **Templates table** — Stores template metadata, pricing, tech stack arrays, feature lists
- **Purchases table** — Tracks memo UUIDs, NEAR transaction IDs, payment status
- **Row-Level Security** — Users can only access their own purchase records

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Memo-based payment matching** — Each purchase generates a unique UUID memo that links the NEAR transaction back to the database record
- **Polling + Webhooks** — Dual confirmation strategy: client-side polling for immediate UX feedback, server-side webhooks for reliable payment processing
- **5-minute timeout** — Payment status page auto-expires to prevent indefinite polling

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Payment Verification Reliability

**Challenge:** Ensuring every crypto payment is accurately matched to the correct purchase without double-spending or missed transactions.

**Solution:** Implemented a unique memo (UUID) system where each purchase generates a distinct identifier. The webhook handler matches incoming payments by memo, and the polling endpoint verifies status independently. This dual-path approach ensures no payment is lost.

### 2. Hackathon Time Constraints

**Challenge:** Building a full marketplace with blockchain integration within the hackathon timeframe.

**Solution:** Leveraged Supabase for rapid backend setup (auth, database, RLS) and shadcn/ui for production-quality components. This allowed focusing development time on the HOT Pay integration and payment verification logic.
